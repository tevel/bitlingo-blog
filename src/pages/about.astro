	<p>
		BitLingo was built for people who learn best by listening—and who don’t have spare screen time.
		We focus on vocabulary because it delivers quick wins: words you choose, in the order you need
		them, practiced through short listen-and-repeat sessions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our principles are simple:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Audio-first.</strong> No screen required. Safe for commutes and compatible with walking or lifting.</li>
		<li><strong>Hands-free.</strong> Playback controls are voice-friendly and predictable.</li>
		<li><strong>Your vocabulary only.</strong> Import your own words—travel phrases, exams, or industry jargon.</li>
		<li><strong>Private by default.</strong> Data is stored locally; no account is required.</li>
		<li><strong>Offline-ready.</strong> Works as a PWA so you can practice without signal.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		BitLingo is not a translation tool and not a full grammar course. It’s a focused, free way to
		turn “eyes-busy, ears-free” time into steady vocabulary growth. If that sounds like you, the blog
		posts here share workflows, habit tips, and product updates to help you get more from every
		session.
