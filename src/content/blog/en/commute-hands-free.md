If your eyes are busy steering or scanning train stops, you can still grow your vocabulary. BitLingo is built to be audio-first, so you never need to look down at a screen. It’s a **hands-free language learning app** purpose-built for commutes.

## Quick setup (2 minutes)

- Open BitLingo and add 10–20 words you actually need this week. Keep it narrow: travel phrases, exam verbs, or on-the-job jargon.
- Enable autoplay with short pauses between prompts so you can repeat out loud.
- Set playback volume that competes with road or train noise without blasting your ears.

## Safe, hands-free controls

- Start a session before you pull out or while you wait on the platform.
- Keep your phone mounted or in your pocket; no swiping required.
- Use vehicle controls or earbuds to pause if you need to focus on traffic.

## Session recipe for commutes

- **Length:** 8–12 minutes (fits a typical city drive or two subway stops).
- **Mode:** listen–repeat on shuffle to avoid memorizing the order.
- **Goal:** accurate recall of 80% of the list; no need to cram everything.

## Why it works

- Audio-first keeps your eyes where they belong—on the road or your surroundings.
- Short loops prevent mental fatigue and make it easy to resume later in the day.
- Custom vocabulary means every minute reinforces words you chose, not a generic syllabus.

## Keep the momentum

- Pair this routine with a <a href="/blog/en/custom-vocabulary-workflow/">custom vocabulary workflow</a> so every commute list is relevant.
- When you’re back home or offline, switch to the <a href="/blog/en/offline-practice-guide/">offline language learning guide</a>.
- If you want a daily system, use the <a href="/blog/en/habit-playbook-bitlingo/">habit playbook</a> to lock in 10-minute “learn vocabulary during commute” loops.

Make your commute pay you back. Ten focused minutes per ride is over **80 minutes** of vocabulary practice each workweek. That's real progress without carving new time out of your day.
