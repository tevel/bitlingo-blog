BitLingo is built around **your** vocabulary—not ours. Here’s a fast workflow to go from idea to a practice-ready deck using audio flashcards for language learning.

## Step 1: Pick a narrow theme

- Travel: airport, hotel check-in, food orders.
- Work: industry jargon, meeting verbs, common questions.
- Exams: frequency lists for CEFR/DELE/HSK.

Limiting scope to 20–40 words keeps sessions short and repeatable.

## Step 2: Add words with smart prompts

- Enter the target word plus a short cue in your native language.
- Add a quick usage note only if it helps recall (e.g., gender, polite form).
- Keep entries terse so audio playback is clean and easy to repeat.

## Step 3: Set playback for recall

- Enable shuffling to avoid order memorization.
- Choose a pause length that lets you repeat twice.
- Turn on slower playback for brand-new words; speed up once confident.

## Step 4: Test and trim

- After one session, archive words you own and replace with new ones.
- Track “stumbles” by quickly re-adding them to a micro-list for later.

### Why this beats generic curricula

- **Relevance:** every minute reinforces words you need right now.
- **Retention:** small, themed sets are easier to keep in long-term memory.
- **Flexibility:** swap lists per context—commute list, weekend list, business trip list.

## Next steps

- Use this deck on a <a href="/blog/en/commute-hands-free/">learn vocabulary during commute</a> routine for truly hands-free language learning.
- Heading to the gym? Pair it with <a href="/blog/en/workout-language-sessions/">learn languages while working out</a>.
- Want consistency? The <a href="/blog/en/habit-playbook-bitlingo/">habit playbook</a> keeps these custom lists in rotation.

Build a deck today, practice tonight, and adjust tomorrow. That’s the loop that keeps vocabulary growth compounding.
