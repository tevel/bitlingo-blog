Your workout time is already blocked on your calendar. Use it to reinforce vocabulary without breaking form or focus with a hands-free language learning app.

## Choose the right movements

- Steady-state cardio: treadmill, rowing, cycling, walking.
- Strength circuits with predictable rest windows.
- Avoid heavy Olympic lifts during playback—pause if you need full attention.

## Ideal session structure

- **Warm-up (5 minutes):** slow playback, new words only.
- **Working sets (15–25 minutes):** shuffle mixed new + familiar words.
- **Cool-down (5 minutes):** repeat the top five trouble words.

## Safety tips

- Keep phone in a pocket or on a shelf—no mid-set tapping.
- Set volume so you can still hear your surroundings.
- Use single-earbud mode outdoors to stay situationally aware.

## Why BitLingo fits workouts

- Audio-first means zero screen dependency for “audio flashcards” style drills.
- Hands-free controls keep your grip and posture intact.
- Custom lists let you align vocabulary difficulty with workout intensity.

Consistent weekly training already builds discipline. Attach micro language gains to that habit and you’ll see measurable progress without extending your schedule.
